# Business Case
## Objective:
The aim of this project is to analyse customer behaviour and operational trends related to coffee orders, ratings, and pricing data. This will provide insights for decision-making in optimising pricing strategies, improving product offerings, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Technologies to be leveraged:
Google Sheets & Excel: Initial data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Formula-based calculations, pivot tables, and basic visualisations. Highlight trends in coffee orders, pricing, and ratings.
MySQL: Centralised database for all data.
Complex querying for trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.
Tableau: Advanced data visualisation and dashboard creation. Present key findings to stakeholders with actionable insights.
Python: Perform statistical analysis (e.g., regression, hypothesis testing). Automate data cleaning processes. Advanced analytics including predictive modelling.

## Business Problem:
There is a need to understand how pricing fluctuations affect sales and customer satisfaction, alongside analysing customer preferences from orders and rating data. Additionally, the project aims to optimise the operational aspects by uncovering trends in product performance and demand cycles.

## Goals and KPIs:
Increase Customer Satisfaction: Use ratings data to identify and improve top-rated products while addressing poorly performing ones.
Revenue Optimisation: Analyse pricing trends to understand their impact on sales and profitability.
Operational Efficiency: Optimise product offerings based on customer order trends and preferences.

##Project Plan
### 1. Business Objectives
Understand Product Demand: Use descriptive analytics to understand which coffee products are in demand and identify seasonal trends.
Optimise Pricing Strategy: Perform diagnostic and predictive analytics to determine how past pricing impacted customer behaviour and forecast future trends.
Improve Customer Satisfaction: Analyse coffee ratings and order preferences to recommend product improvements and promotions.
Data-Driven Decision-Making: Provide actionable insights to business stakeholders via comprehensive Tableau dashboards.

### 2. Stakeholders
Senior Management: For strategic decisions on pricing and product improvement.
Marketing Team: To leverage customer insights for targeted campaigns.
Operations Team: To streamline supply chain and inventory decisions.
Product Development Team: To improve product offerings based on customer feedback and demand trends.
Finance Team: To ensure profitability through optimised pricing strategies.

### 3. Data Analysis Plan (Four Types of Analytics)
A. Descriptive Analytics
Objective: Understand historical trends and patterns in coffee orders, pricing, and ratings.
Tools: Google Sheets/Excel (pivot tables, charts), MySQL queries.
Examples:
Distribution of orders by product and time.
Historical price fluctuations and customer rating trends.
B. Diagnostic Analytics
Objective: Investigate reasons behind trends identified in descriptive analysis.
Tools: MySQL for complex querying, Excel for correlation analysis.
Examples:
Analysing the impact of pricing changes on customer ratings.
Identifying factors behind poor-performing products or low ratings.
C. Predictive Analytics
Objective: Forecast future sales trends based on historical data.
Tools: Python (regression analysis, time series forecasting), Tableau for visualising trends.
Examples:
Predicting future demand for coffee products based on historical data.
Forecasting how price changes could affect sales volumes in the next quarter.
D. Prescriptive Analytics
Objective: Recommend actions to optimise pricing and product offerings.
Tools: Python for optimisation modelling, Tableau for presenting actionable insights.
Examples:
Suggesting optimal pricing strategies to balance profitability and customer satisfaction.
Recommending new product bundles or promotions based on customer preferences.

### 4. Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis Testing:
Example: Test whether price reductions increase sales significantly.
Tools: Python (scipy.stats for t-tests or ANOVA).
Correlation Analysis:
Example: Assess correlation between pricing and customer ratings.
Tools: Excel and Python (pandas, matplotlib).
Regression Analysis:
Example: Build regression models to predict how price changes affect customer ratings and sales volumes.
Tools: Python (statsmodels or scikit-learn).
Time Series Analysis:
Example: Perform time series analysis to forecast future sales trends based on historical pricing and sales data.
Tools: Python (ARIMA or Prophet libraries).

### 5. Project Timeline
Week 1: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Excel and Google Sheets.
Week 2: Set up MySQL database and start performing descriptive and diagnostic analytics.
Week 3: Begin predictive modelling and statistical analysis in Python.
Week 4: Build interactive dashboards in Tableau, compile insights, and create prescriptive analytics.
Week 5: Final review, stakeholder presentation, and portfolio documentation.

## Deliverables
Cleaned Data: Using Google Sheets/Excel and Python.
SQL Database: Centralised MySQL database for querying.
Statistical Reports: Python-generated analysis with visuals (regression models, correlation analysis).
Interactive Dashboards: Tableau dashboards for stakeholders, displaying key insights and actionable recommendations.
Business Insights Documentation: Clear recommendations based on all four types of analytics.
